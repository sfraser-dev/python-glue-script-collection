    # the FirstEntry, I kept using ONLY the first entry to calcualte my risk - my risk WASN'T this much as I would have an average
    # bid entry below this due to layering my bids. The risk-softening-multiplier accounts for this. If I wanted to risk $100 onÂ 
    # a trade and used only the first entry to calculate this risk (but actually had layered bids), my risk-softening-multiplier
    # might be something like 0.75, thus my actual risk would only be $100*0.75 = $75. I never used to layer bids so this was a simple
    # way for me implement it initially - easy for me to update my journal properly and quickly if I calcualed my risk using only
    # the first entry but actually had layered bids.
